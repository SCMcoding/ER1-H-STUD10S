      City Tech’s Center for Holistic Integration (CHI) kicked off in spring 2024 as a modest pilot, pairing the expertise of
      <a href="https://www.citytech.cuny.edu/faculty/DSmith" target="_blank">Dr. David B. Smith</a> and
      <a href="https://www.citytech.cuny.edu/faculty/CSwift" target="_blank">Dr. Christopher Swift</a> with the creative
      energy of students Samuel Cheung and Tshari Yancey. Dr. Smith—a composer, sound designer, and inventor on City Tech’s
      faculty since 1997—helped build one of the first live-performance virtual-orchestra systems and secured a $780K Alfred
      P. Sloan grant. Dr. Swift—Associate Professor of Theatre—earned his Ph.D. in 2012, specializing in medieval Iberian
      performance, puppetry, and the phenomenology of theatrical space.

      For its first mini-exhibition—organized as part of City Tech’s response to anti-Asian hate—the CHI team mounted a
      Wayang kulit shadow-puppet performance that fused centuries-old Javanese storytelling with modern digital tools.
      Samuel Cheung designed every puppet character, while Tshari Yancey developed the story, defined each character’s
      traits, and wrote the full script.

    <p>
      What began as a single showcase has since grown into a large, ongoing research initiative exploring the “blended pace”—
      how AI collaboration can deepen human creativity across performance, narrative, and beyond. CHI continues to study
      Wayang kulit’s rich traditions and reimagine them for today’s digital stage.
