    <h1>THE BLENDED I.R.I.S PROJECT</h1>
<!--    <img src="../Gallery/Portfolio Image/Port1.jpg" alt="Audience" />-->

    <p>Welcome <strong>To A Blended Environment</strong>.</p>

    <p>
     The Immersive Roblox reality space, Blended IRIS, was a personal project I developed between 2021 and 2022. Its core focus was to create an immersive, peaceful hangout influenced by the environments around us. The founding building project I created on Roblox, Cryptic Sanctuary—which features a large castle filled with motivational quotes—became the inspiration for my endeavors to build realistic spaces that simulate nature and let people simply relax. The whole concept traces back to 2020, during the coronavirus quarantine when I found peace in Roblox “vibe” games to make up for the lack of a physical gathering place. The products of this project later paved the way for many other collaborative efforts—our first 3D background, a Hindu temple, was used for the show in spring 2024 in our City Tech shadow puppet theatre, founded by New York City Tech’s Center of Holistic Integration—created through the guidance of artificial intelligence to deliver a blended, immersive interactive experience. The ongoing goal for this mini-project is to create immersive spots where players can hang out.
