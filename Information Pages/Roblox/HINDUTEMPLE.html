    <h1>THE HINDU TEMPLE</h1>
    <!--    <img src="../Gallery/Portfolio Image/Port1.jpg" alt="Audience" />-->

    <p>A <strong>virtual place filled with history and ancient history</strong>.</p>

    <p>
      The Hindu Temple was a Roblox project crafted as part of a City Tech project that celebrates Asian culture. The game served as a virtual background for our Wayang Kulit puppet show, produced by New York City Tech’s Center of Holistic Integration to celebrate Hindu and Javanese culture through a physical performance augmented by modern, AI-generated scenery. As one of the original scenes, the Hindu Temple became the first 3D animated background used in the show. Two versions were created—one for previewing the space and another for a character-interaction scene. The temple features a vast circular room, with each wall hosting different doors tied to the storyline. At its center stands a circular pagoda beneath which sits a large Ganesha statue and accompanying altars. After the play was refurbished, the temple remained one of the few original backgrounds retained while most others were updated. A copy of its interior now serves as a background for the newer production. The game is still open for anyone to visit.
