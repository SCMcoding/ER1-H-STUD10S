    <h1>CRYPTIC STRONGHOLD &amp; Hazelstrum Castle</h1>
    <img src="../Roblox/Gallery/Hazelstrum Fortress/H1.png" alt="Fading Remnants">

    <p>A castle that holds<strong> many secrets. (This is an ongoing build)</strong></p>

    <p>
      Cryptic Stronghold is a myth-inspired vibe game I launched on December 20, 2022,
      to merge immersive storytelling with a relaxed gameplay environment. What began
      as a modest house grew into a full island crowned by a castle brimming with
      hidden narratives. Each chamber offers its own story, and the floors are laid
      with inspirational quotes—a nod to Stampylongnose’s Love Garden. As the flagship
      build for the Blended I.R.I.S. project, Cryptic Stronghold was paused in 2023
      due to performance constraints in Roblox Studio.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Available Rooms Within the Castle:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Main Chambers</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Grand Lobby:</strong> First point of entry, decorated with sea-life motifs and numerous quote tiles. Houses a moving whale statue inspired by the blue whale exhibit at the Museum of Natural History.</li>
          <li><strong>Hall of Encouragement:</strong> Chess-themed, aquatic room lined with quote tiles. Animated humpback whale statues “swim” along the ceiling, evoking Hogwarts’ Great Hall.</li>
          <li><strong>Chamber of Abyss:</strong> Dining hall designed for socializing, with multiple tables and an animated kraken statue overhead. The kraken’s animation logic was repurposed for other moving statues throughout the castle.</li>
          <li><strong>Teleport Ports:</strong> Balcony outside the dining hall features four teleport elevators, each leading to a separate mini-game I developed.</li>
          <li><strong>The Oracle’s Hall:</strong> Expansive chamber adjoining the dining hall, tiled with quotes and fitted with storage alcoves. A central lion statue guards a pedestal that teleports players to the “Oracle’s Heart” game.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Tower Chambers</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Music Room (Basement Level 1):</strong> Contains playable instruments, including a pipe organ. Only one song can play at a time—triggering multiple instruments simultaneously causes overlap.</li>
          <li><strong>Tea Hut (Main Floor):</strong> Intimate spot for private hangouts.</li>
          <li><strong>Blank Rooms:</strong> Two unfinished spaces shelved due to ongoing studio lag.</li>
          <li><strong>Roof:</strong> Tiled area for additional quotes with an elevator to a private central room (owner &amp; select guests only).</li>
          <li><strong>Room of the Arch Cardinals (Tower Summit):</strong> Exclusive chamber for the arch cardinals to observe the castle.</li>
          <li><strong>Head Cardinal’s Watch Tower (Tower Tip):</strong> Secret retreat for the owner, closed to the public.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
