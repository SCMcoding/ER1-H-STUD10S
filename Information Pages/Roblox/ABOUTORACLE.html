    <h1>THE HEART OF THE ORACLE</h1>
    <!--    <img src="../Gallery/Portfolio Image/Port1.jpg" alt="Audience" />-->

    <p> A forest <strong> Within the unknown</strong>.</p>

    <p>
      The Oracle’s Heart is a realm I created on February 28, 2023—shortly after Cryptic Stronghold’s release—serving as a portal-connected extension of the castle. Players can access it in Roblox or via a pedestal in the Oracle’s Hall beneath the giant lion statue. The Oracle’s Heart unfolds within a small forest surrounded by lion statues similar to the one in the main game, suggesting that players inhabit the sentience of these once-living guardians, now petrified. Acting as a secondary vibe game, it also includes an elevator that returns players to the main experience.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Available Rooms Within the Castle:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Main Castle Building</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Grand Lobby:</strong> First point of entry, decorated with sea-life motifs and numerous quote tiles. Houses a moving whale statue inspired by the blue whale exhibit at the Museum of Natural History.</li>
          <li><strong>Hall of Encouragement:</strong> Chess-themed, aquatic room lined with quote tiles. Animated humpback whale statues “swim” along the ceiling, evoking Hogwarts’ Great Hall.</li>
          <li><strong>Chamber of Abyss:</strong> Dining hall designed for socializing, with multiple tables and an animated kraken statue overhead. The kraken’s animation logic was repurposed for other moving statues throughout the castle.</li>
          <li><strong>Teleport Ports:</strong> Balcony outside the dining hall features four teleport elevators, each leading to a separate mini-game I developed.</li>
          <li><strong>The Oracle’s Hall:</strong> Expansive chamber adjoining the dining hall, tiled with quotes and fitted with storage alcoves. A central lion statue guards a pedestal that teleports players to the “Oracle’s Heart” game.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Tower Rooms</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Music Room (Basement Level 1):</strong> Contains playable instruments, including a pipe organ. Only one song can play at a time—triggering multiple instruments simultaneously causes overlap.</li>
          <li><strong>Tea Hut (Main Floor):</strong> Intimate spot for private hangouts.</li>
          <li><strong>Blank Rooms:</strong> Two unfinished spaces shelved due to ongoing studio lag.</li>
          <li><strong>Roof:</strong> Tiled area for additional quotes with an elevator to a private central room (owner &amp; select guests only).</li>
          <li><strong>Room of the Arch Cardinals (Tower Summit):</strong> Exclusive chamber for the arch cardinals to observe the castle.</li>
          <li><strong>Head Cardinal’s Watch Tower (Tower Tip):</strong> Secret retreat for the owner, closed to the public.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
