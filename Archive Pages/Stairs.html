    <h1>The Stairs</h1>
    <p class="section-text">For my final project, I initially planned to create a music video. However, due to time constraints, I opted to focus on a short skit that can be looped instead. After reviewing my previous projects, I chose to film the skit in my house's basement. Initially, I considered a skit inspired by FNAF, from the perspective of the night guards, but abandoned this idea because the storyline was too abstract and closely resembled a previous project of mine.</p>

    <h2>Story Concept</h2>
    <p class="section-text">The skit features a delivery man retrieving parcels in the basement of a random apartment complex. As he tries to leave with his heavy package, he discovers he's stuck in a perpetual loop. The stairs continually return him to his starting point. Stumped, the delivery man makes several unsuccessful attempts to escape, including walking backward, assuming that this trick will break the loop. He eventually gives up after repeatedly failing to leave.</p>

    <h2>Creating The Skit</h2>
    <p class="section-text">After extensive research and browsing online, I was inspired by Zach King’s YouTube skits, which often feature endless-loop content. I wanted my skit to be short, simple, yet entertaining, so I centered it around the basement stairs. Consistent camera angle and lighting were crucial. Everything was recorded in one take sequence to ensure seamless transitions.</p>

    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p class="section-text">Lighting consistency proved key: a loop only succeeds if the surroundings match perfectly. Some takes were scrapped due to the camera's auto-focus and auto-exposure shifts. To maintain visual cohesion, I later added a dark overlay to obscure the basement door and hallway, creating the illusion of a larger space and preventing the delivery man from seemingly popping into view.</p>

    <p class="section-text">Near the end of the skit, a box that the delivery man carries accidentally disappeared due to a removed prop—an oversight I couldn’t reshoot. For each loop, I applied a fade transition at the points where the character ascends and reappears, ensuring the loop felt instant and consistent.</p>
